# DazScript Types

This project provides TypeScript typings for [Daz Studio](https://www.daz3d.com/), a 3D software with an SDK that uses an ECMAScript compliant language.

## Overview

This project aims to provide TypeScript typings for Daz Script, making it easier to use in a TypeScript environment.

From [Daz Script Documentation](http://docs.daz3d.com/doku.php/public/software/dazstudio/4/referenceguide/scripting/start):

> Daz Script 2 is a dynamically-typed, interpreted, object-oriented scripting language that is tightly integrated with the Daz Studio API. It is an extension of Qt Script, which is an extension of ECMAScript as defined in the ECMAScript Language Specification (ECMA-262), 5.1 Edition.

> Syntactically Daz Script is very similar to JavaScript, JScript, and ActionScript.

## Usage

To use these typings in your project, install the package from npm:

npm install dazscript-types

Then, you can import the types into your TypeScript files:

import { MyType } from 'dazscript-types';

Replace `MyType` with the actual type you want to use.
